**PASSWORD RESET AUTOMATION**

**Tools:** UiPath Studio (REFramework), UiPath Orchestrator, Microsoft Excel, Outlook, Microsoft Edge, Windows 10 VM.  

**Project Overview:**  
Designed and developed an unattended RPA solution in UiPath Studio using REFramework to automate the employee password reset process for an enterprise environment. The automation processes input Excel data to reset passwords via a web-based system and sends out temporary credentials securely via email.  

**Responsibilities:**  
•	Developed an end-to-end unattended automation solution in UiPath Studio using REFramework to reset employee passwords securely and efficiently.  
•	Created Two Modular Workflows:  
•	Dispatcher_PasswordReset: Extracted user data from Excel attachments in Outlook and pushed items into the Orchestrator queue.  
•	Performer_PasswordReset: Processed queue items, automated browser-based password reset, and sent email notifications with temporary credentials.  
•	Used UiPath Orchestrator for scheduling, asset management, credential storage, and monitoring.  
•	Implemented transaction retry logic, error handling, and logging following best practices in REFramework.  
•	Designed the automation to run on Windows Virtual Machine (VM) with preconfigured system environments.  
•	Followed enterprise password policy standards for compliance and security.  

**Achievements:**  
•	Reduced manual password reset time by 80%, from multiple minutes to 1 minute 13 seconds per transaction.   
•	Automated a process previously requiring 3 full-time employees (FTEs) with peak volume of 50 transactions every 15 minutes.  
•	Enhanced process monitoring and traceability through structured logs and error categorization.
